A few tips for those who send cold emails. :handshake: Specifically, our best practices to avoid being trapped by spam filters and reach more prospects with your campaigns.

- Switch to dedicated IP address
- Set up and regularly monitor DNS settings (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, BIMI: you can do it manually or with record generator tools);
- Respect sending limits (do not send 1000 emails per day per mailbox if your email service provider recommends 250);
- Make the ‘from’ line trustful (name, surname, and company name must be real);
- No caps lock, spam words, or exclamation marks in the subject line;
- Do not insert links or images with the first cold email (your prospects’ are not supposed to hear from you, any links will be considered suspicious);
- Check your email copy for spam triggers;
- Keep email lists clean (regularly validate them and stay away from bounces);
- Do the warmup properly (increase the limits gradually, interact with recipients with high sender scores).
