A few tips for those who send cold emails. :handshake: Specifically, our best practices to avoid being trapped by spam filters and reach more prospects with your campaigns.

- Switch to dedicated IP address
- Set up and regularly monitor DNS settings (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, BIMI: you can do it manually or with record generator tools);
- Respect sending limits (do not send 1000 emails per day per mailbox if your email service provider recommends 250);
- Make the ‘from’ line trustful (name, surname, and company name must be real);
- No caps lock, spam words, or exclamation marks in the subject line;
- Do not insert links or images with the first cold email (your prospects’ are not supposed to hear from you, any links will be considered suspicious);
- Check your email copy for spam triggers;
- Keep email lists clean (regularly validate them and stay away from bounces);
- Do the warmup properly (increase the limits gradually, interact with recipients with high sender scores).

maybe we should do a custom markdown tag "[separator]" that will be replaced with ***?
[#355](https://github.com/LLazyEmail/markdown-to-email/issues/355)

----

Can we add some warnings for preview text, for advertising blocks too?

our goal will be to add URL param like `?ref=noonifications.tech` but let's use some working module, aka extension of `path` module.
because there can be tons of stupid issues that I want to skip

"_create 3 npm calls for generating full-template for 3 different cases(only plain version is necessary right now):_" - Этот момент не оч понятен

"_maybe we should do a custom markdown tag "[separator]" that will be replaced with ***?_" - Это уже готово

"_Can we add some warnings for preview text, for advertising blocks too?_" - Для previwText есть warning - когда парсим фулл контент в консоли выводится красным что previwText нету

"_can we clean up our constants package? [#356](https://github.com/LLazyEmail/markdown-to-email/issues/356)_" - В этом не очень уверен

Над последним пунктом Вадим работает как помню

сейчас у нас вызывается генератор с помощью одной команды.
и генерирует он темплейт только в том случае, когда есть вся информация сразу. - это первая команда.

но т.к. клиенты иногда тупят - мы генерируем темплейт, но не имеет в этот момент данных от спонсоров.
это будет вторая команда.

третья команда в package.json будет тоже генерировать темплейт, но в котором нету блоков от спонсора совсем. пример: https://www.noonifications.tech/w/FrS0z4j1mwy0iPFsU6N2Ig
Сейчас, с помощью нашего генератора, такой layout не просто сделать. приходится потом руками удалять блоки
